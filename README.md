## About

As an assistant coach, I found it tedious to go through an opponent team's matches to find their weak map and their strong map. So I created this tool that scrapes recent games veto from VLR.GG.
The tool gets first map bans and first map picks, and it is open source, so feel free to expand it. **Update** (Now go through all pages) 

Head to Releases Tab to download an excutable, or proceed below.
